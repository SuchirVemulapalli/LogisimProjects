# 7 Segment Hex Decoder 

This circuit uses two input primitive logic gates to build a 7 segment hexadecimal decoder. The combinational logic was simplified using minterms and Karnaugh maps. A 7 segment hexadecimal decoder is a decoder that displays hex digits based on the value being fed to its 7 external connections(or segments).
