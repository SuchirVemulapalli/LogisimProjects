# LogisimProjects

A series of personal projects made in Logisim Evolution, an expanded version of the original Logisim by Dr. Carl Burch. 

Logisim-Evolution is a tool that allows users to graphically model logical circuits using several different hardware components. Logisim transcribes these circuits into a netlist with the HDL being based around Java.
